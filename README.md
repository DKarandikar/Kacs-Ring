# Kac's Ring
Basic python script to provide a visualisation of the Kac's Ring

## What is Kac's Ring?

The Kac's ring provides an example of a microscopic time-reversible system that can still (minimally) be said to exhibit thermodynamic behaviour. The simulation demonstrates how a microscopic system undergoes recurrence in a finite time, despite the overall system looking thermodynamic. A good starting reference for more details on this, and it's relation to the philosophy of physics (specifically of the foundations of statistical mechanics), can be found in Gottwald and Oliver's paper "Boltzmann’s dilemma – an introduction to statistical
mechanics via the Kac ring", which can be found at http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/gottwald/preprints/kac-ring.pdf


## Running

Simply clone the repo or download just the python file and then run it as ```python KacRing.py```
